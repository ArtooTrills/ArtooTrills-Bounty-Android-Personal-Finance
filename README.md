We are all on a tight budget. We know we need to be saving money but we just don't know where it disappears. It's first of the month, I have received my salary ... It's 5th of the month, and most of it has disappeared!

Doesn't this sound familiar? The first step is to bring in visibility into your income and expenses. Instead of manually inputing this data, we can extract this data from SMS and emails.
